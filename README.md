# Reinforcement Learning for Game Playing

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to implement and train a reinforcement learning agent to play a selected game effectively. The objectives include understanding and defining the game environment, selecting an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm, training the agent, and evaluating its performance. By the end of the project, we aim to have a well-trained agent capable of making intelligent decisions within the game context.

## Method

The project will begin by selecting a suitable game environment, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or CartPole. An implementation of the chosen game will be developed or adopted. The reinforcement learning algorithm, likely Deep Q Networks (DQN), will be implemented to train the agent. The training process will involve adjusting hyperparameters and monitoring the agent's learning curve. Visualizations, including learning curves and videos of the agent's gameplay, will be created to understand the training progress. Comparisons with alternative reinforcement learning algorithms may be explored to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Benefits Expected to Be Gained

Upon successful completion, the project will yield a trained reinforcement learning agent proficient in playing the selected game. The benefits include gaining hands-on experience in reinforcement learning, understanding the dynamics of training an intelligent agent, and acquiring insights into the challenges associated with game-playing tasks. This project contributes to the broader field of artificial intelligence by demonstrating the application of reinforcement learning techniques in a concrete and interactive setting.

## Primary Tasks and Outcomes

- Game Environment Definition and Implementation: Define the rules and dynamics of the selected game and implement the game environment.

- Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementation: Choose and implement a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as DQN, to train the agent.

- Performance Evaluation and Documentation: Evaluate the trained agent's performance, create visualizations of the learning process, and document the methodology, results, and insights gained throughout the project.
